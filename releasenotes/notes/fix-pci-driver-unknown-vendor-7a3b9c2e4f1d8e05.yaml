    Fixed a crash in the PCI driver where discovery of devices with
    vendor IDs not present in the vendor map would raise an
    ``AttributeError``. The PCI driver now gracefully handles unknown
    vendors by skipping the vendor-specific trait and falling back to
    using the raw vendor ID as the driver name.
