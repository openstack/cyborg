    The 2026.1 release focuses on reducing technical debt and improving
    operational reliability. The most significant change is the removal of
    the eventlet dependency, completing Cyborg's migration to native
    threading for oslo.service and oslo.messaging. Database session
    management has been modernized to use the current oslo.db enginefacade
    API, replacing the legacy facade that was removed upstream.
    Additionally, the cyborg-agent now validates its Placement resource
    provider at startup, fixing a long-standing hostname mismatch issue
    between Cyborg and Nova. Several accelerator driver bugs have also
    been corrected.

    The documentation has also been enhanced, a new driver configuration
    guide has been added covering all supported accelerator drivers
    with configuration examples and troubleshooting tips, and a release
    liaison guide has been added for contributors.
