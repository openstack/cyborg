upgrade:
  - |
    Cyborg no longer uses eventlet. The eventlet dependency has been
    removed and Cyborg now uses the native threading backend for
    oslo.service and the threading RPC server. No configuration
    changes are required. Packagers should ensure that
    ``oslo.service[threading]`` is installed as a dependency.
